Hello everybody, 

I am  Ivan Felipe Rodriguez from Bogot√°, Colombia. I got my bachelor's degree on math on 2015 at Universidad Sergio Arboleda. For this 2016 I will be at Puerto Rico University Studying a Master degree on Scientific Computing. 

I have to say, it has been not too much time ago since I began programming, it came to pass that some friend introduced me to this world and now I am loving it! I decided to start this master mostly because I found Maths and computers match pretty well and I love them both. As well the  university gave me so many facilities, that I felt inside this time was the best time to begin. I am grateful for this opportunity and  I want to learn the most. 

This blog is a learning excercise. The first thing that mean is I am not an expert, I will be, but right now it is possible that you find a lot of mistakes on grammar, coding and theory, therefore  all the feedback you guys want to provide me would be more than welcome. The second thing that mean is  I will be writing for learners and beginners, I want other people to have access to resources that might help them in their particular situations. The last thing it means, is that I would encourage everyone who ever use this blog to reply and cooperate with the posts and let me notice is being used. 

Let me describe a little bit clearer how I will set up this blog. 


## Organization of the blog:

* Subjects: In this section, I will be uploading selected topics, problems and other stuff related to the subjects I will be taking at RUM.
* Station Q: My favorite research topic is on Quantum Computing. Therefore I will be uploading  articles and personal writings about it. Mostly about Algorithms, introductory readings and stuff related with my thesis.     
* Projects: This entrance is specially addressed to present some projects on web development that I have been working with my friend @d555. Who is doing his master at EAFIT university.
