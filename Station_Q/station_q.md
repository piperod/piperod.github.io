## Welcome to Station Q. 

This section is specially addresed to one topic I really like and  I have been looking at for a long time: Quantum Computing. It was when I turned 13 that I first read an article about this topic, "Quantum Computing for non- Physicist" by Eifel Polak et all. Since then I have being understanding little by little the BASIC stuff of the theory. 

The thesis for my Math bachelor's was The topology of quantum Algorithms, a new semantics  developed on Oxford University lead by Bob Coecke and Jamie Vicary, looking to simplify the way Quantum Computing should be understood. Specifically I focused on the way can be proved mathematically the correctness of an algorithm. 

I will be posting here little by little depending on the time the master leave me, but I promise this section is "the special one" so I will be posting stuff with a lot of work and dedication. 

I hope you guys like it.
