 Let $$f(x,y) = 2x^3-3x^2-6xy(x-y-1)$$ be a convex function over $$\mathbf{R}^2$$. We want to calculate the stationary points. To do so I need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the gradient.
    $$\nabla f = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        6x^2 - 12xy - 6x + 6y^2 + 6y\\
        6x + 12xy - 6x^2
        \end{bmatrix}
     $$
2. Critical Points. 
Now we have to solve the linear equations system:

$$\nabla f = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        6x^2 - 12xy - 6x + 6y^2 + 6y\\
        6x + 12xy - 6x^2
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        0\\
        0
        \end{bmatrix}
     $$
Adding both lines we obtain:

$$ 6y^2+6y=0 \\
    6y(y+1)=0$$

Therefore there are two options for y, $$y=-1$$ and $$y=0$$.  

* Case 1: $$y=0$$
    Replacing in the second line we obtain
    $$6x-6x^2= 0$$
    then $$x=0$$ or $$x=1$$

    This case we have the points: (0,0) and (1,0). 

* Case 2: $$y=-1$$
    Replacing in the second line we have:

    $$6x -12 x -6x^2=0 \\ -6x-6x^2=0$$
    then $$x=0$$ or $$x=-1$$

    This case we found the points: (0,-1) and (-1,-1).

 The \textbf{stationary points} are:

    $$\textbf{(0,0),(0,-1),(1,0), (-1,-1)}$$

Now we need to see wheter if they are local minima,  local maxima, or neither. 
To do so, we first need to calculate the gessian, which is our third step. 

3. f''=$$

  \begin{bmatrix}
       12x-12y-6 & -12x+12y \\
        6-12x& 12x
     \end{bmatrix}$$
